## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The working that did for this project was to complete the Q-training Alogrithm Coding block with the provided code. The code that I myself was the deep Q-learning alogrithm.
The code was created to allow exploration and/or exploitation for the the intelligenace agent in order to find the treasure. 

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

New technology as well as software are created by computer scientists. The apps, websites, and programs we use on a daily basis are designed and made by computer scientists. Ensuring the safety and security of their creations for users is the main duty of computer scientists. . Computer scientists focus on enhancing current technologies as well as developing new ones. They do out research to determine how computers can carry out more tasks or speed up the tasks.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

How I approach any problem as a computer scientist is making sure that I understand the beginning, the middle, and the end of the problem. Understanding what results in the problem, what is occurring during the problem, and what happens after the problem is a key step one know what to do next to fix the problem. There are a few steps a computer scientist can take to solve a problem. The first step is to determine the problem's aim or objective. The second step is to ensure that you are aware of your limitations and as well as the resources available to you. The third step is to consider potential ways to solve the issue while making effective use of your resources. The fourth step is to put your solution into practice and evaluate its effectiveness. Finally, the fifth step is to consider the reasons behind the choices you made and how they affected the solution's final result. 

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My  ethical responsibility to the end users and the organization is thinking about how my work may impact society as a whole in addition to developing new technologies or resolving technical issues. To prevent any possible conflicts of interest, I need to make sure that I am are not in anybody in harm's way and that they respect their privacy.
