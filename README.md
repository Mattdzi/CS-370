## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The working that did for this project was to complete the Q-training Alogrithm Coding block with the provided code. The code that I myself was the deep Q-learning alogrithm.
The code was created to allow exploration and/or exploitation for the the intelligenace agent in order to find the treasure. 

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

To keep it short, computer scientists handle with research and development of new computational systems such as hardware, software, or algorithms. Technology is evolving everyday thanks to computer scientists.
computer scientists apply thier knowledge to solve computational problems or make steps forward into the new technology advancements in society.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

How I apporach any problem as a computer scientist is making sure that I understand the beginning, the middle, and the end of the problem. Understanding what results in the problem, what is occuring during the problem, and what happens after the problem is a key step
on know what to do next to fix the problem. 

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
